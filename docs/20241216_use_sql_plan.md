## Project Plan: Repository-Specific Filtering and Summary Caching with SQLModel and FastAPI

### Objectives

1. **Implement Repository-Specific Filtering Settings:**

   - Allow each repository to maintain its own filtering configuration, stored in the database.
   - Provide API endpoints to manage (create, read, update, delete) these filtering settings.

2. **Optimize Summary Generation with Caching:**

   - Cache repository summaries in the database to improve performance.
   - Invalidate the cache whenever filtering settings are updated.
   - Ensure the cache remains valid indefinitely as long as filtering settings are unchanged.

3. **Enhance Testability:**

   - Use the repository pattern to abstract database operations for filtering settings and caching.
   - Enable easy replacement with mock repositories for testing.

### Deliverables

1. **Database Schema**

   - `FilterSettings` table for repository-specific filtering configurations.
   - `SummaryCache` table for storing cached summaries.

2. **API Endpoints**

   - **Filtering Settings:**
     - `GET /repositories/{repository_id}/filter-settings`: Retrieve filtering settings for a repository.
     - `PUT /repositories/{repository_id}/filter-settings`: Update or create filtering settings for a repository.
   - **Summary with Cache:**
     - `GET /repositories/{repository_id}/summary`: Retrieve a repository summary, using cached data if available and valid.

3. **Repository Classes**

   - `BaseRepository`: A generic repository class for common CRUD operations.
   - `FilterSettingsRepository`: Specialized repository for managing filtering settings.
   - `SummaryCacheRepository`: Specialized repository for managing summary caching, including cache invalidation.

4. **Testing Infrastructure**

   - Use mock repositories to decouple tests from the actual database.
   - Provide SQLite in-memory database setup for integration tests.

### Implementation Plan

- Design database schema with `FilterSettings` and `SummaryCache` tables.
- Implement repository classes for CRUD operations and cache management.
- Develop API endpoints for managing filtering settings and retrieving summaries.
- Write unit and integration tests to ensure functionality and robustness.
- Conduct end-to-end testing and finalize documentation.

---

### Milestones

- Define database models and create migration scripts.
- Implement `FilterSettingsRepository`, and `SummaryCacheRepository`.
- Develop API endpoints for filtering settings (`GET` and `PUT` operations).
- Integrate caching logic into the summary generation process.
- Write unit tests for repository classes and API endpoints, including edge cases.
- Implement integration tests using SQLite in-memory database.
- Perform end-to-end testing and optimize performance.
- Document the implementation, including API specifications and test coverage reports.

### Risks and Mitigation

1. **Cache Staleness:**

   - Risk: Cache might return outdated data.
   - Mitigation: Automatically invalidate cache when filtering settings are updated.

2. **Database Overhead:**

   - Risk: Increased read/write operations.
   - Mitigation: Optimize queries and use efficient JSON serialization for cached summaries.

3. **Testing Complexity:**

   - Risk: Mocking repositories may introduce inconsistencies.
   - Mitigation: Use SQLite for realistic integration tests.

### Tools and Technologies

- **Frameworks:** FastAPI, SQLModel
- **Database:** SQLite (local testing): SQLite is lightweight, requires no setup, and is ideal for quick prototyping and testing. It also supports in-memory databases for isolated test environments.
- **Database Migrations:** Alembic or SQLModel's built-in migration utilities can be used for schema management.
- **Testing:** pytest, pytest-mock
- **Dependency Management:** Poetry or pip-tools **Frameworks:** FastAPI, SQLModel
- **Database:** SQLite (local testing), PostgreSQL/MySQL (production-ready setup)

### Expected Outcome

- A fully functional API with repository-specific filtering and summary caching.
- Improved performance by reducing redundant summary generation.
- A robust testing suite ensuring reliability and maintainability of the implementation.
